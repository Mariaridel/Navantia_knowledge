What is a frigate

The frigates are vessels designed to achieve the strategic objectives of the National Defence of any nation in the 21st century. There are its antisurface, antisubmarine and especially antiaircraft capabilities which make this vessel the essential platform to guarantee the defense and control of all areas under the sovereignty of a country.
Additionally, they are an indispensable tool in a Nation’s Foreign Policy, acting both in conflict operations and in peace and humanitarian missions, as well as in the performance of UN resolutions.
Its high capacities and the flexibility to operate both in coastal areas and on the high seas allow it to act as command and control vessel in operations with allied fleets, providing the required coverage.
Navantia is a world reference in the design and construction of frigates, having built the F-100 for the Spanish Navy, as well as different ships for the Norwegian Navy or the Australian Navy. Navantia is currently developing the F-110 frigate program for the Spanish Navy.

F110, the frigate of the 21st century

Navantia started in 1996 the design of the frigate F-100. More that 20 years later and with 13 ships of this family built, with different versions and for several countries (Spain, Norway and Australia) the innovative and new frigate F110 aims to maintain Navantia’s world leadership position as a designer and builder of frigates and their further life cycle support.
The F-110 is a multipurpose battleship that represents a substantial step forward towards the Smart Ship concept. The vessel integrates the best of industry 4.0 technologies, that will improve her construction, operation and life cycle management.
Navantia has started the construction process of the new F-110 class frigate for Spanish Navy, with the cutting of the first steel plate in an event presided by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez.
The programme, whose implementation order was signed in 2019, foresees the construction of five frigates, valued at 4,320 million euros. The F-111 will be commissioned in 2027 and deliveries will take place yearly.
The cutting of the first steel plate has taken place the 6th of April in Navantia’s shipyard in Ferrol (A Coruña, Spain), where all five F-110 class frigates will be built. The event was also attended by Spanish Vice Prime Minister for Labor and Social Economy, Yolanda Díaz; Finance Minister María Jesús Montero, along with Navantia’s Chairman, Ricardo Domínguez; VP for Shipbuilding, Agustín Álvarez; VP for Systems and Services, Donato Martínez, and Ferrol shipyard’s director, Eduardo Dobarro, among other authorities.
The F-110 frigates for the Spanish Navy are multi-purpose escort ships, with anti-aircraft, anti-surface, and anti-submarine capabilities to perform their force protection and naval power projection duties. They will operate in combination with other units, and they are versatile platforms that can also perform functions related to maritime security and support to civilian authorities.
The design of this new frigate includes advanced technological features, such as an integrated mast with different sensor and antenna solutions, a multi-mission space that expands the ship’s capabilities in all defence segments and a new, more efficient and silent hybrid propulsion plant, providing the ship with great versatility. The frigates will be equipped with the Spanish combat system, SCOMBA, developed by Navantia Sistemas.

Digital Twin

The F-110 frigate will be a smart ship, the first Spanish naval programme designed to have a Digital Twin: a virtual replica of the ship that constantly receives information from the vessel, data permanently supplied by a network of sensors distributed throughout the ship, constituting a cyber-physical system that through the use of behavioral models and technologies such as Cloud Computing, Machine Learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) allows to support its maintenance and operation even thousands of miles away through the Digital Twin deployed ashore.
The Digital Twin is complemented by an Integrated Services System (ISS), an R&D developed with the Universities of Vigo and Coruña, which will provide the ship with integrated sensors in its light points, substantially reducing its wiring. The F110 will also have 3D printers on board for the manufacture of spare parts.
They will be the first ships in the fleet to have an integrated cybersecurity system to protect the vessels against increasing cyberthreats. This will enable the ship to have a reduced crew complement for operation, which will result in improved habitability.

A reference in frigates

Navantia is a leader in the construction of frigates. In the last 20 years Navantia has successfully developed 5 programs, including the current F-110 program for Spain, with a total of 17 ships.

With all this acquired experience, and always maintaining a common design strategy, Navantia has defined a frigates family with different sizes and adapted to the most demanding scenarios and missions. This design strategy aims to maximize the survival of the ship.
The diverse Navantia frigate designs cover a range from just over 2,200 t. of displacement to ships over 6,000 t, and adapt the capabilities and performance of their different systems to the size and missions of the ship.





Support to Norwegian frigates

Navantia has signed an agreement with the Norwegian Logistics Agency for Defense (NDLO), a FOTS agreement (Follow on Technical Support) to support the Nansen class (F-310) Norwegian frigates life cycle.
Currently, as a designer, builder and developer of the systems of these frigates, result of an evolution of the F-100 project, Navantia provides several services, including:
•	Maintenance and development of the IPMS (Integrated Platform Management System) new features
•	Performance of obsolescence reports about Systems and their components
•	Spare parts supply and element repair
•	Technical assistance for scheduled maintenance tasks, especially in propulsion systems
•	Design and on-site implementation of new functionalities
•	Management of design databases
Navantia develops these tasks with a high degree of customer satisfaction in terms of quality and compliance with deadlines, as a result of which the initial agreement signed in 2013 has been renewed in 2017 for a similar period of time.
It also provides support to the life cycle of the 5 frigates of the Spanish Navy and support activities for the 3 Australian DDGs (AWD).

System integrator

The development of Navantia in the vessel desing field has been complemented by its training as a Combat System integrator and supplier of integral solutions, mainly acquired as a result of the F100 frigate program.
Navantia has managed to create and evolve a national solution of the critical systems of the Spanish Navy ships and channeled it to export products.
Thus, the Integrated Platform Control System (SICP), the SCOMBA Command and Control System, the CATIZ (the SCOMBA variant for export), the Dorna Shooting Directorates and the NAVCOM / Hermesys Integrated Communications System are consolidated products since their incorporation in the F-100 class frigates configuration.

Norwegian Defence congratulates Navantia for the successful of tropicalization works of F-311 frigate

The Norwegian Defence Material Agency (NDMA) has congratulated Navantia and its subcontractors for the successful completion of the tropicalization of HNoMS F-311 Roald Amundsen, second of the Fridjof Nansen Class (F310) that Navantia designed and built for the Norwegian Navy between 2000 and 2011.
These works, for which the contract was signed on July 2020, has significantly improved the cooling capacity of the F311 frigate, which will allow it to navigate in conditions of much warmer ambient and water temperatures than the traditional operational scenarios of the Royal Norwegian Navy.
The modification, taken place from January to June 2021, has consisted on the replacement of the 3 refrigeration plants and the modification and increase of the air-cooling equipment in the engine rooms. The installation of this new equipment also has entailed the change of pipes, conduits, wiring, electrical panels, etc. that has made this program a great challenge both for the development of all the necessary engineering and for the execution of the works, both dismantling and installation, between Ferrol and Norway.
Another great challenge of this program is the platform on which the engineering has been developed. The F310 was developed with currently inoperative computer tools, so the decision has been made to develop the program already in Siemens NX in order to align it with the new Navantia digital platform. For this, 3D models of the necessary blocks were already migrated, and construction engineering work was developed in this tool.
The whole contract has been conducted under rigid sanitary protocols due to Covid 19, from travel restrictions, meeting restrictions or quarantines of the staff moved to Bergen, witch has been an additional challenge for all the workers. NDMA has praised the team abilities for adapting to this situation.
In words of Commander Espen Holtar, “during the project, Navantia has shown themselves as a relevant and trustworthy supplier with knowledge and ability to deliver in accordance to original and new requirements in the project”. Furthermore “it is worth mentioning that NDMA will be using this project as a model for future projects on the Nansen class frigates”.
Miguel Diaz, Navantia liaison engineer and works manager in Norway has highlighted the support and collaboration of all Navantia team and other subcontractors as Quest Global, Imafer, Soamar, Electro Rayma and Bulbo.
“We have been scored 9,5 out of 10 by the NDMA, for the fourth year in a row, and this has been possible thanks to a team of extraordinary professionals who have performed their work with the highest level of competence, qualification and ability” he adds.

F-110 
The frigate to the future

The F-110 frigates for the Spanish Navy are multipurpose escort ships, with anti-aircraft, anti-surface, and anti-submarine capabilities to perform their force protection and naval power projection duties. They will operate in combination with other units, and they are versatile platforms that can also perform functions related to maritime security and support to civilian authorities. The program valued at 4.325 million euros, was signed in 2019, and includes the construction of five frigates,. The first of class will be delivered in 2027 and the follow-on units at one year intervals. The program involves 500 companies from all over Spain, generating 9,000 jobs. The F110 will represent a qualitative leap from the point of view of the Navy's capabilities and the industrial and technological potential of Navantia and all its collaborating industry. It thus contributes to Spain's strategic autonomy and cutting-edge industrial and technological base, while at the same time opening new export opportunities. The program is the digital transformation lever for the Navantia shipyard in Ferrol, which will become an international reference in frigates, with innovative concepts such as new digitized factory and Digital Twin Center of Excellence. 

A TECHNOLOGICAL LEAP FORWARD 

The F110 frigates have a hybrid Combined DieselElectric And Gas (CODLAG) propulsion that in its electric mode allows them to operate silently, enhancing their anti-submarine capability, as well as substantially improving the environmental impact thanks to the higher efficiency. They feature a multi-mission space that increases the flexibility of the vessels' configuration to deploy unmanned vehicles or provide a second helicopter hangar . They also have an integrated mast deploying state-of-the-art sensors whilst reducing the radar signature. It is a smart ship designed as part of a digital ecosystem that optimizes design, construction, operation and maintenance activities in a cybersafe environment. Among its new features are:

DIGITAL TWIN 

It is the great project in terms of technological innovation applied to the naval industry. The Digital Twin, designed in close collaboration with the Spanish Navy and the Directorate General of Armament and Material (DGAM) of the Ministry of Defense, is a virtual replica of the ship that constantly receives information from the vessel, data permanently supplied by a network of sensors distributed throughout the ship, constituting a cyberphysical system that through the use of behavioral models and technologies such as Cloud Computing, Machine Learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) allows to support its maintenance and operation even thousands of miles away through the Digital Twin deployed ashore. The Digital Twin will: - Provide decision support - Obtain in real time behavioral patterns, usage conditions, lubricant status, temperatures, thermographs, vibrations and corrosions, to make effective reliability-based maintenance. - Through this new interactive digital environment, enhance the capacity for instruction and training of personnel. Complemented with the Integrated Services System (ISS), it will improve quality of life at sea.

ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING 

The F110 will carry 3D printers on board in order to print some of its spare parts, thanks to collaboration with Navantia's Center of Excellence for Additive Manufacturing (CEFAN), located in Puerto Real (Cadiz) and the Spanish Navy.

INTEGRATED SERVICES SYSTEM 

The Integrated Services System (ISS) is an initiative in collaboration with the Universities of Vigo and Coruña to develop an architecture based on the ship's 2,000 light points, a neural network that provides a significant reduction in the ship's wiring volume, while supporting the incorporation of the 4.0 technologies mentioned above. It currently integrates functionalities such as lighting, public address, monitoring, TV cameras, secure wireless access services and diverse sensorization into a single system, also allowing interaction with crew members.


INDUSTRIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT

Some 500 companies from all over Spain are participating in the program. The high degree of nationalization stands out, since almost 65 percent of the orders placed upto January 2022 are with Spanish suppliers. Navantia's Systems division is a supplier of numerous systems, including the: Integrated Platform Control System, Cybersecurity System, Integrated Bridge and Navigation System, Integrated internal and external Communications System, and the SCOMBA combat system. These developments performed by a Spanish company reinforces strategic sovereignty. This nationalization of equipment reflects the maturity of various technologies - of a dual nature - that has been taking place in Spain. Thus, almost two thirds of the F110's equipment is Spanish, all of it integrated in a frigate that is at the highest level of technological excellence among escort ships worldwide in this first half of the 21st century. This driving role of Navantia among the collaborating industry also means that these companies grow in international competitiveness and opens doors to new business opportunities in different countries. The F110 program will generate around 9,000 jobs between Navantia’s own workforce and auxiliary direct employment, with further indirect jobs. 437 million euros per year of direct contribution to GDP. The impact on aggregate demand is estimated at 1300 million euros per year. Each euro of Navantia's turnover generates 1 euro of GDP. The F110 offers new export possibilities: in the case of the F100, export contracts were generated for the same amount as the program's budget. The modularity of the F110, as well as the automation of processes, make this frigate a very competitive product.

DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

The F110 is being the lever of Navantia's Digital Transformation Plan at the Ferrol shipyard, driving a new digital ecosystem. The shipyard, which is already in the process of becoming a "zero paper" production center, will have a new Block Factory that will involve an investment of 100 million euros. It is a fully digitalized, automated and robotized factory, including advanced technology machinery, which guarantees the optimization of the product, its versatility and the reduction of delivery times. In this new manufacturing line, the traditional welding process is replaced by hybrid laser technology, substantially improving performance and minimizing distortions. In Ferrol, Navantia will also locate its Digital Twin Center of Excellence, one of the centers of excellence of the network that Navantia is implementing in all its shipyards. The center of excellence will act as a strategic meeting point, generating innovation opportunities in the Ferrol region. It will also provide service to all Navantia's centers, monitoring the performance of all the ships designed and manufactured by the company. Both innovations use the key technologies that enable the digital transformation commonly known as 4.0 in the field of Industry. The aim of the project is to optimize operations, facilitating the development of new products and services thanks to the use of interoperable technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Modeling and Simulation, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), Industrial Robotics, 3D Printing, Cloud, Virtual and Augmented Reality, New Digital Platforms, Cybersecurity,... a total of 14 enabling technologies so that physical assets and people are connected to their digital twins in an intelligent way. The digital twin is the key to this model, which has laid the foundations for new concepts such as "smart ship", "smart plant" and "smart support services".
